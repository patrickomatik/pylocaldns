# IP Address Usage Checking Feature

I've implemented a comprehensive IP address usage verification system to prevent address conflicts in your DHCP server. This feature automatically detects and handles IP addresses that are already in use on your network.

## How It Works

When the DHCP server is about to allocate an IP address, it now performs several checks:

1. **Multi-Method Network Checking**:
   - **Ping Test**: Sends a single ping with a short timeout
   - **Port Scan**: Tries connecting to common ports (80, 443, 22, etc.)
   - **ARP Table Analysis**: Checks system ARP tables for existing entries

2. **Pre-Allocation Detection**:
   - If an address is in use but not in our system, it gets marked as "pre-allocated"
   - These addresses are automatically added to your configuration
   - They're removed from the DHCP pool to prevent conflicts

3. **MAC Address Discovery**:
   - The system attempts to discover the MAC address of the device using the IP
   - It analyzes ARP tables across different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - When found, the MAC-to-IP mapping is recorded

## Added Benefits

1. **Improved Network Discovery**:
   - Automatic detection of devices not manually configured
   - Helps map your network topology even for devices you didn't set up

2. **Conflict Prevention**:
   - Eliminates "IP already in use" errors on clients
   - Prevents network disruptions from duplicate IP assignments

3. **Configuration Auto-Updating**:
   - Discovered devices are automatically added to your hosts file
   - Pre-allocated entries are tagged for easy identification
   - Provides automatic documentation of your network

## Technical Details

- Uses platform-specific ARP commands for maximum compatibility
- Implements timeouts to prevent scanning delays
- Sorts available IPs for deterministic allocation
- Updates configuration files with newly discovered devices

## Example Output

In your hosts file, you'll see entries like:

```
# Pre-allocated entries have 'preallocated' in their hostnames
192.168.1.120 device-192-168-1-120 preallocated
192.168.1.121 device-192-168-1-121 [MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55]
```

This allows you to easily identify which addresses were automatically discovered and preallocated to prevent conflicts.
